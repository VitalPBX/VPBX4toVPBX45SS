# Debian Upgrade and Cleanup Script (Including VitalPBX 4 to 4.5 Migration)

This script automates the process of upgrading a Debian 11 system to Debian 12 and includes a seamless migration from **VitalPBX 4** to **VitalPBX 4.5**, along with cleanup tasks to optimize the environment.<br> 
Before upgrading your system, it is strongly recommended that you make a full backup, or at least back up any data or configuration information you can't afford to lose. The upgrade tools and process are quite reliable, but a hardware failure in the middle of an upgrade could result in a severely damaged system.

Please read the [Debian Release Notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-upgrading.html) to be clear about the risks

## üìã How the Script Works

**Step 1:** Upgrade Current System (Bullseye) <br>
Upgrades the current system to the latest version available for Debian 11.
```
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -y
```
**Step 2:** Update Sources to Debian 12 (Bookworm) <br>
Updates APT source files to point to Debian 12 repositories.
```
sed -i 's/bullseye/bookworm/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
sed -i 's/bullseye/bookworm/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list
```
**Step 3:** Hold VitalPBX Packages <br>
Prevents critical VitalPBX packages from being removed or modified during the upgrade.
```
apt-mark hold $(dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package}\n' -W 'vitalpbx*')
apt-mark hold logger-core
apt-mark hold provisioning-core
apt-mark hold vitxi
apt-mark hold $(dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package}\n' -W 'sonata-*')
```
**Step 4:** Perform a Complete Upgrade <br>
Executes a system upgrade in two stages: first without installing new packages, followed by a full upgrade.
```
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs -y
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt full-upgrade -y
```
**Step 5:** Unhold VitalPBX Packages <br>
Releases held VitalPBX packages to allow further updates.
```
apt-mark unhold $(dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package}\n' -W 'vitalpbx*')
apt-mark unhold logger-core
```
**Step 6:** Update VitalPBX Repository <br>
Modifies the VitalPBX repository file to point to version 4.5..
```
sed -i 's/v4/v4.5/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vitalpbx.list
```
**Step 7:** Disable Apache2 <br>
Stops and disables Apache2, modifying its configuration to avoid port conflicts.

sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/" /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```
**Step 8:** Upgrade VitalPBX <br>

php /usr/share/vitalpbx/scripts/vitalpbx "optimizeNginxSettings"
```
**Step 10:** Remove Obsolete Packages <br>

```
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt --purge autoremove -y
