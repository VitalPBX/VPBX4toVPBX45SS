# Debian Upgrade and Cleanup Script (Including VitalPBX 4 to 4.5 Migration)

This script automates the process of upgrading a Debian 11 system to Debian 12 and includes a seamless migration from **VitalPBX 4** to **VitalPBX 4.5**, along with cleanup tasks to optimize the environment. It is especially useful for testing environments but can be used in production systems **at your own risk**.
